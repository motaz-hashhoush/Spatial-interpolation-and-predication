# Spatial-interpolation-and-predication

Data provided

1.	areleva1 (Raster): digital elevation model / raster data with elevation values 

2.	Snow points (Vector) : the distribution of snow stations provide snow depth at the station locations 

3.	DAM line (Vector) : location to build the dam 

4.	Ridges (Vector):  the line made where two sloping surfaces come together



Tasks 1. Predict and create a continues surface represent snow 

1.	Create continues surface representing the snow over the area. 

2.	Validate the predicted surface and provide direction for which interpolation methods bring better results 

Task 2. Find the best location for a skiing resort consider the following criteria 

1.	Proper slope

2.	Proper shading 

3.	Proper oreigntaion - Not directed toward sun
